*Notes:
- set MAC settings to manual in system preferences
- do not connect to desired wifi network until running script and new MAC address is set

Should work on Mac OS/X; depending on make and model of laptop the command to set the MAC address may differ from what I have here, (en0 or en1 or en1 Wi-Fi).
